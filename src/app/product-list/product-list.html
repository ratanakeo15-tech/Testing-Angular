 <!-- an interceptor is like a middleware for HTTP requests and responses. -->

 <!-- Think of it as a security guard + postman standing at the door of your HttpClient. -->

<!-- the interceptor can:

Inspect the request/response

Modify it

Log it

Handle errors -->

<!-- When Interceptors Are Useful

Attach Authentication Tokens
Add a JWT or API key to every outgoing request automatically.

Log Requests and Responses
Track all API calls for debugging.

Handle Errors Globally
Instead of writing .catchError() in every service, handle all 401/404/etc. in one place.

Modify Responses
Transform data before it reaches your components. -->

<!-- What is hybrid rendering?
Hybrid rendering allows developers to leverage the benefits of server-side rendering (SSR), pre-rendering (also known as "static site generation" or SSG) and client-side rendering (CSR) to optimize your Angular application. It gives you fine-grained control over how your different parts of your app is rendered to give your users the best experience possible. -->
